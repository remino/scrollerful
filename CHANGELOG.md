## [1.0.0] - 2024-04-14

If you were using any version before 1.0.0, there are numerous breaking changes:

- The `scrollerful` prefix has been shortened to `sclf`. This affects CSS class names, JavaScript functions and events. See below for a list.
- The top element wrapping all containers is no longer needed.
- Nomenclature of `inner` and `outer` sprites has been changed to `contain` and `cover`, respectively, matching upcoming CSS standards.
- Event names have been changed to match the new prefix and have colons in them.
- Addition of rudimentary `animation-timeline` support.
